# Text Reconstruction in Natural Language Processing from NER and Their Relationships

## First Part
Implemented a model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction adapted to Spanish text. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as spaCy, NLTK, and Scikit-learn, the model was trained to classify entities and relationships in textual descriptions of images. Despite challenges posed by language-specific limitations, the model achieved notable performance in entity recognition, demonstrating its potential for domain-specific applications in Spanish.

## Second Part
The goal is to transform structured data, which contains information about objects and their relationships, into coherent and semantically rich textual descriptions. The methodology involves preprocessing the JSON data, training the BART model, and evaluating its performance using standard metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR. This project demonstrates the feasibility of using pre-trained language models for generating descriptions from structured data, with potential applications in content generation, virtual assistants, and accessibility.
